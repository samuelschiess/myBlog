**_An Introduction to my blog_**

My name is Sam Schiess, and I'm currently working on my Master of Science, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at WGU (say that 10 times fast!) I'm starting this blog to document my learning journey, reinforce learned concepts by talking about them, and also just to have fun. Read more to learn about me and my studies!

_My Career Until Now:_

- I am a Senior IT Specialist at the University of Utah, focusing on financial technology, managing third-party software (like Jaggaer and Nelnet). For this role, I also act as a delegated developr building forms and workflows in ServiceNow.
- I haven't always done IT - I actually used to be a school band teacher! I realized pretty quickly that full time teaching wasn't for me, but I still love music, and teaching (in small doses)
- Pivoting my career looked daunting at first, but I got some Comptia certifications, made a ton of job applications, and soon got a job as a help desk technician. Soon after, I got my current role at the University of Utah. The job I have now felt completely unachievable a few years ago, but reaching it has boosted my confidence - I feel like I can do anything now!

_My Aspirations Going Forward:_

- The AI Dream: I am fascinated by the progress of AI - and want to work with it directly. I don't think we've scratched the surface of what these new transformer models can really do for us, and I want to be part of that discovery process.
- Specific Roles: I am considering a range of roles, such as Machine Learning Engineer, MLOps, or AI Solutions Architect.
- A Love of Learning: I love learning new things and quickly get bored at work when I don't have enough new things to learn. I don't think that will be a problem working with AI. I've spent so much time learning about neural nets and back propagation and TensorFlow on YouTube and Udemy, yet there's still so much I want to learn.
- The Accomplishment of it: I'm excited to have a computer science degree! And a Master's degree! It's an accomplishment I will be proud of, for its own sake. I'm also excited to get past HR filters on job applications.
- The Financial Goal: I unashamedly want to increase my financial stability. Home ownership is a goal of mine, and I want to be able to support a family. I think building and utilizing machine learning models will be great career skills for the future.

_Outside of Work:_

- In my personal time, I cycle between hobbies such as hiking, gardening, cooking, swimming, traveling, and more.

_What to Expect from This Blog_

I can't promise too much at this moment. I'm going to figure this out as I go! But expect me to post about concepts I learn at least once a week. Definitely expect me to link to projects I am building on Github. Finally, expect me to reflect on my experiences as an online student.

I might also break from routine and post thoughts about anything on my mind!

Welcome, and please enjoy!
